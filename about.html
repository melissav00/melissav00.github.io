    <center><p id="begin">The Blank Project was started in 2017 in Miami by four local women. This program is commited to aid women in finding a career. At The Blank Project, we connect women seeking employement with employers in a variety of buisnesses. We help guide each client with the best profession, focusing on their strengths and skill set. </p>
    </center>

  <p id="begin"><h3><center>Why?</center></p></h3>
  <p id="begin"><font face="Arial">We started this program because of the need in our community to increase employment oppertunities for women. There is a large number of women who can not support themselves or their family because of the lack of employment. We believe that women should have the privilage to work in jobs where they are not discriminated. Our goal is to empower women around the globe to believe that they are powerful and capable of being successful in a career.</font></p>
  <center><h3>Our Team</center></h3>
  <div>
  <p id="begin">The team of women who founded The Blank Project are participating in Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program 2017. We all agree that there needs to be an improvement with women in the work place. Each of the members on our team is passionate about this cause and how this program can help women in the future.</p>

        <p id="begin">"I am determined to give women a chance to experience getting a career. We have worked hard on creating The Blank Project to make women in Miami feel special. My team is willing to encourage women in getting jobs that helps them financially. I believe that women should be more involved in the workplace. I am a woman living in Miami and I have seen more men working than women, which is very unfair. We are willing to make a change so that women have the same oppertunity as men." </p>

          <p id="begin">"Like many students of Miami-Dade County, my parents are not from the United States. My parents were born in Argentina and immigrated to the United States when they finished their high school in Buenos Aires in order to have a better life in this great country. Between the process of assimilating to a new country, my mom never learned about all the job opportunities in Miami, and didn't have many resources or advice available. That's why I decided to be part of this team, to inspire women and help open the doors of career success and opportunity."</p><br>

      <p id="begin">"At sixteen years old, I developed a passion for learning and technology. Starting when I taught my little sister how to use our family laptop; Girls Who Code has taught me how to share my knowledge with others towards a better future. This experience has expanded my knowledge in developing responsive websites, and advanced web development with Girls Who Code. Not only have I developed this love for learning, but have also built functioning robots with my grandfather, and developed websites for mental health awareness. I believe all women can be prosperous and empowered to expand their knowledge."</p>
