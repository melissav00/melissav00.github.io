				<h4><strong>Register with Agencies</strong></h4><br>
					<h4>Recruitment agencies can be an effective source for job hunting and many have the option for registering online, rather than physically going to the office. The more agencies you register with, the greater your options, so it is well worth taking the time to broaden your options.</h4><br>
				<h4><strong>Social Media</strong></h4>
					<h4>Social media can offer a wide range of options when it comes to searching for a job online. There is a job searching facility on LinkedIn for instance, but you can also let your connections know that you are currently seeking work. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter also allow you to search for keywords, so you can find relevant jobs which suit your skills and experience. Many headhunters use social media to find candidates, so make sure your profile contains as much information as possible on what you can offer.</h4><br>
				<h4><strong>Networking</strong</h4>
					<h4>When it comes to searching for a job online, you need to be proactive with your search. You can use platforms such as LinkedIn to find useful connections, such as recruiters or business owners and ask them if they have any opportunities. Advertising jobs via job sites can be costly, so many employers choose to head-hunt instead. You never know what opportunities you might discover if you broaden your network and you will also show employers that you are proactive in your job search.</h4>
